# Volatility Modelling and Option Pricing

This project implements numerical methods in **C++** and **R** to price European options, estimate **implied volatility**, compute **historical volatility**, and visualize market dynamics based on real-world financial data.

It was originally developed as part of a university research project focused on derivative pricing and volatility modelling.

---

## Objectives

- Apply the **Black-Scholes model** to compute option values.
- Estimate **implied volatility** using Newton-Secant numerical methods.
- Calculate **historical volatility** from time series price data.
- Visualise time series and volatility behaviour using **R**.
- Compare theoretical values with real market approximations.

## Methods & Tools

### C++ Components

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01_simpson_integration.cpp` | Implements Simpsonâ€™s Rule for numerical integration. |
| `02_option_value.cpp` | Computes European call/put option value using Black-Scholes. |
| `03_virtual_function.cpp` | Object-oriented version with virtual payoff functions. |
| `04_newton_secant.cpp` | Estimates root using the Newton-Secant method. |
| `05_implied_volatility.cpp` | Computes implied volatility given market price. |
| `06_implied_volatility_loop.cpp` | Computes implied volatility across varying strike prices. |
| `07_historical_volatility.cpp` | Estimates historical volatility using stock price log returns. |

### R Components

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01_plot_timeseries.R` | Visualises stock price time series (Open, Close, Adjusted Close). |
| `02_plot_iv_vs_strike.R` | Plots implied volatility against strike price. |
